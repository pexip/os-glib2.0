Subject: gwinhttpfile: Avoid arithmetic overflow when calculating a size
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The members of `URL_COMPONENTS` (`winhttp_file->url`) are `DWORD`s, i.e.
32-bit unsigned integers. Adding to and multiplying them may cause them
to overflow the unsigned integer bounds, even if the result is passed to
`g_memdup2()` which accepts a `gsize`.

Cast the `URL_COMPONENTS` members to `gsize` first to ensure that the
arithmetic is done in terms of `gsize`s rather than unsigned integers.

Spotted by Sebastian Dr√∂ge.
